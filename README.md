# Personal Portfolio Site

## Description

A personal portfolio website built with [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs).

I originally built the site with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [Emotion](http://emotion.sh), with custom bundling and build processing using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). React and Emotion are great and I have really enjoyed working with them.

But then I took a position with a new company that has me working primarily with Svelte for the front end, and I thought it would be interesting to remake the site using Svelte.

Svelte is a great new front end framework that's very intuitive to work with, and Svelte Kit is a terrific application framework for developing and deploying sites quickly to any number of platforms.

## Details

The site is fairly clean and simple on a single page. There's no permanent navbar, but
an expandable nav menu provides smooth scrolling to corresponding section
of the website.

Sections:

- Hero Image Home and Title
- Contact Info and Resume
- About Me Summary
- Sample Projects: a selection of projects with links to live deployments
  as well as to Github for further details and information.
